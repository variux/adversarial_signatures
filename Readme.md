# Characterizing adversarial examples for Signature verification

This repository contains code to evaluate attacks against CNN-based and 
LBP-based models [1], as well as scripts to evaluate
two defense mechanisms for CNN training (Madry defense [2] and Ensemble adversarial Training [3]).

Installation
============

First install the package [sigver](https://github.com/luizgh/sigver) as follows:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/luizgh/sigver.git --process-dependency-links
```

Download (or clone) this repository and install its requirements: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the LBP experiments, you need to have Matlab installed, and install the python/matlab integration:

https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html

## Example 

An interactive example can be found in the ```example.ipynb``` file, that can also be viewed in this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/luizgh/adversarial_signatures/blob/master/example.ipynb). This example considers the following tasks:

1. Extracting features and training a WD classifier for a user
2. Perform a type-I attack (change a genuine signature so that it is rejected)
3. Perform a type-II attack (change a skilled forgery so that it is accepted)


## Reproducing the paper

To reproduce all steps in the paper you need access to the four datasets (GPDS, MCYT, CEDAR, Brazilian PUC-PR). 
To reproduce the result for a single dataset, you need access to this dataset, and the models 
trained on GPDS (see the [trained models section](#Trained-models)). Please note that I cannot share the datasets, so please directly 
contact the groups that proposed the datasets to have access to them (MCYT and CEDAR have public access).

To reproduce the paper, the following steps are necessary:

1. Train the CNNs on GPDS: ```scripts/train_cnns.sh``` (or use the trained models below)
2. Process the datasets - extract lbp and signet features: ```scripts/process_datasets.sh```
3. Train classifiers and select the images to be attacked (only images that are correctly classified by all models): ```scripts/choose_files.sh```
4. Run LBP attacks: ```scripts/lbp_attacks.sh```
5. Run CNN attacks: ```scripts/cnn_attacks.sh```

The scripts ```scripts/process_results.sh``` and ```scripts/process_results_[defense/otsu].py``` process the results and generate latex tables
